# Lab Overview

You must document all of your attacks including all steps, commands issued, and console output in the form of a penetration test report. Your documentation should be thorough enough that your attacks can be replicated step-by-step by a technically competent reader!

Time Management
Avoid rabbit holes

Set a timer per machine:
- I.e., 2-3 hours per stand-alone machine and 4 hours for the AD set.
- The 4 hours can be broken down for each AD machine.
- After getting a shell, allot another two hours for privilege escalation.
- If time runs out, move on. It's easy to get lost in troubleshooting.
- Working on a different machine or taking a break lets you come back with a fresh perspective.
